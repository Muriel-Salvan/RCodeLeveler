= RCodeLeveler

A Ruby file parser that enables/disables source code sections based on conditions.
Very handy to implement debugging logs and code that has to be commented (and not just dynamically switched off) when not needed anymore.

== What is inside this Gem/Zip/TarBall file ?

* <tt>./lib/</tt>: The RCodeLeveler library.
* <tt>./examples/</tt>: A quick and easy to understand example showing basic functionality.
* <tt>./test/</tt>: The complete tests that validate the library.
* <tt>./AUTHORS[link:AUTHORS.html]</tt>: The list of authors that have contributed.
* <tt>./Bugs[link:Bugs.html]</tt>: The list of known bugs up to date.
* <tt>./Credits[link:Credits.html]</tt>: The credits.

== How to install it ?

=== From the Gem file

1. First install RubyGems if it is not the case already (you can check by typing 'gem' in a terminal).
   You can download it from http://rubygems.rubyforge.org.
2. Type 'gem install <TheFileYouDownloaded>.gem' from a terminal.
   If you want to first run regression testing before installing it, use '-t' option:
     gem install -t <TheFileYouDownloaded>.gem

=== From the Zip or TarBall file

==== Under Unix

1. Unzip/Untar the file in a directory ('unzip <TheFileYouDownloaded>.zip' or 'tar xvzf <TheFileYouDownloaded>.tar.gz' from the directory you want to install to).
2. Add the path to the ./lib directory to your $RUBYLIB environment variable:
     export RUBYLIB=$RUBYLIB:<AbsolutePathWhereYouUnzippedTheFile>/lib
   Next time you execute a ruby program from this terminal, you will be able to use "require 'rcodeleveler'".
   To make the setting permanent, you can put it in a login script (such as .bashrc).

==== Under Windows

1. Unzip/Untar the file in a directory.
2. Add the path to the ./lib directory to your $RUBYLIB environment variable (you can put it in a login script):
     set RUBYLIB=%RUBYLIB%;<AbsolutePathWhereYouUnzippedTheFile>/lib
   Next time you execute a ruby program from this terminal, you will be able to use "require 'rcodeleveler'".
   To make the setting permanent, you can modify your environment in 'Control settings'=>'System'=>'Advanced'=>'Environment variables'.

== Where is the documentation ?

Documentation is part of the first comments of the file lib/rcodeleveler.rb. It can be read as it is.

However all the source code is commented and formatted to be readable using rdoc.

=== From the Gem file

It can also be viewed 2 ways:
1. You can use 'ri rcodeleveler.rb',
2. or read the generated rdoc (usually in <RubyInstallationDirectory>/gems/<RubyVersion>/doc/<NameOfInstalledGem>/rdoc/index.html).

=== From the Zip or TarBall file

It can also be viewed from the rdoc generated from the sources: type './generateRDoc.rb' from the directory where you unzipped the files, and read ./doc/index.html with a web browser.

== How to see the basic functionality ?

Go in the ./examples directory and run
  ruby -w SimpleExample.rb
  
Reading the first comments of file lib/rcodeleveler.rb is very quick and useful to catch all the possibilities.

== How to launch the regression testing ?

Go in the ./test directory and run
  ruby -w run.rb

== Who wrote it ?

Check the AUTHORS[link:AUTHORS.html] file.

== What is the license ?

You can find out in the LICENSE[link:LICENSE.html] file.
